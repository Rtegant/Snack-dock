Snack-dock is simply an accumulation of acrylic panels.

Once you have obtained the acrylic panels from the CAD file, 90% of pregress is complete.

The CAD file includes two modules: one for the palm rest and the other for the platform. 

With these two modules, you can adjust the thickness of your Snack-dock.



Here is my recipe:

Thickness of each acrylic panel: 5T
Number of palm rest panels: 3 (15mm is the perfect fit for the Snack box!)
Number of platform panels: 2

To assemble the panels, I used three M6 x 30mm flat-head bolts, two M6 x 15mm flat-head bolts, and five cap nuts.
